lang.oracle.syntax
==================

What
----
Oracle code syntax configuration files to be used with text editors that support TextMate syntax highlighting definitions (TexMate, e Text Editor, Sublime Text)

Type of syntax supported

- FNDLOAD ldt files
- SQL*Loader control files
- SQL\*Plus scripts (SQL, PL/SQL and SQL*Plus commands)

Who
---
People who write their Oracle scripts using text editors rather than IDEs

Why
---
I'm used to do my Oracle coding using a text editor, so it helps having the syntax highlighted if the feature is available. I have tried different tools and the ones supporting TextMate syntax highlighting work better for me. The reason for this is that it allows me to find typos easily and correct them before compiling, this goes beyond keywords into proper block opening and closing which helps on identifying less obvious mistakes and omissions . The nature of syntax identification also allows to tag subprogram headers to navigate among them.

It should be noted that this is a natter of personal preference, I don't endorse a particular editor or negate the possibility of using an IDE. The best tool is the one you have at hand.

Where
-----
Editors I've worked with supporting the syntax definitions here offered

+ Textmate Bundle
  - Textmate
  - Sublime Text
  - e Text editor

How
---
Refer to each editor documentation on how to use the bundles, beware of operative system particularities. I can help with issues, by I can't commit to a timeline given other priorities.
