lang.oracle.syntax
==================

What
----
Oracle SQL and PL/SQL Syntax configuration files to be used with text editors that allow them for highlighting.

Additional configurations included to also highlight the following Oracle tools syntax:

- FNDLOAD ldt files 
- SQL*Loader control files
- SQL*Plus commands

Who
---
People having to deal with oracle source files i.e.  pl/sql stored procedure, sql*plus scripts.

Why
---
I typically do my coding on a text editor or a console, so it helps having the syntax highlighted when available. 

This is a natter of personal preference, I don't endorse a particular editor or negate the possibility of using an IDE.

Where
-----
Editors I've worked with them:

+ Texmate Bundle
  - Textmate
  - Sublime Text
  - e Text editor
  
How
---
Refer to each editor documentation on how to use the bundles, beware of operative system particularities as you might have to account for that when using textmate bundles.
